# my personal website!

this website is my personal website. you can click on the different tabs to learn more about me! i made it through the girls who code pathways program, and it uses html and css. i struggled a lot with some of the formatting, especially with the lists on the snackbar page, since it wasn't aligning the way i wanted to! i learned a lot about html, and this project helped me understand padding, margins, and borders a lot better.
